<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICY</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b>Your Obligations in Outline</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An employer which has not previously taken steps to comply
with its obligations under health and safety law should proceed as follows:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Prepare a health and safety policy, send it to everyone
     and put it on the intranet or noticeboard. Also tell people that there is
     some mandatory training coming.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Carry out health and safety risks assessments and
     implement the results.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Provide training.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Keep records.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How to Proceed</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE)
website has a huge amount of reference material and guidance on your obligations
and appropriate precautions (<a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/">http://www.hse.gov.uk/</a>).
The person responsible in your organisation should visit that site. S/he should
then prepare your health and safety policy and carry out a risk assessment. If you
have five employees or more these must be in writing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following the risk assessment you must do the following.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Make arrangements for implementing the safety measures identified
     as necessary by the risk assessment (for example that will normally include
     holding a fire drill at least annually and having a system for workstation
     assessments). See below for notes on what are likely to be the main areas
     of concern.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Appoint competent people (e.g. responsible support staff) to
     help implement the arrangements.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Provide clear information and training to employees.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>If relevant, work together with other employers which share
     the same workplace.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>This document does not duplicate
the helpful precedents and information on the HSE site. However below is an example
of what a health and safety policy may look like for a typical firm. Also see the
separate Socrates precedent Health and Safety Risk Assessment precedent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Firms vary, so these precedents must
not be merely copied. You should go through the risk factors itemised on the HSE
website and apply them to your firm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>It is good practice for the
senior management of the firm to make a statement emphasising its commitment to
health and safety. This may appear in an email in which you circulate your
policy to all staff. Alternatively it may appear as a prologue to the policy
itself. See the “Commitment Statement” example below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Large firms, or those which have
unusual risks, should consider engaging a specialist consultant. We have been
assisted in drafting this policy by Chris Lumley, an OHS consultant with
considerable experience of advising professional firms. If you would like Mr Lumley’s
contact details please email <a href="mailto:info@socrates-training.co.uk"><span
style='color:windowtext'>info@socrates-training.co.uk</span></a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b>The Main Areas to Address</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>In a typical office the main
risk areas will be these.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><u>Workstation assessments</u>:
     In respect of workers who regularly use “display screen equipment”
     (computer screens etc) as a significant part of their normal work (that is
     daily, for continuous periods of an hour or more) you must:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>carry out workstation
      assessments (see the HSE questionnaire at <a
      href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/ck1.pdf"><span style='color:windowtext;
      text-decoration:none'>http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/ck1.pdf</span></a>
      which you can use for this purpose; alternatively the Socrates training
      module includes a questionnaire users can complete which also meets this
      need);</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>make sure controls are in
      place, and provide information and training;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>provide eye tests on request
      for employees, and special spectacles if needed;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>review the assessment when
      the user or equipment changes.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><u>Stress</u>: This is can be
     a major risk area. Consider using events like annual performance reviews
     to check whether people may be at risk. Consider the messages you give to
     managers about their duty to ensure people are not put under excessive
     strain, and what they should do if there appears to be a problem with an
     individual.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><u>First aid</u>: In larger
     workplaces it will normally be appropriate for some staff to have been
     trained in first aid. Also a minimum requirement is a suitably stocked
     first-aid box. Your risk assessment should indicate whether any additional
     materials and equipment are required such as scissors, microporous
     adhesive tape, disposable aprons and moist wipes.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><u>Fire safety</u>: You will
     normally want to check with your landlord as to which responsibilities are
     managed by the landlord and which by the tenant. Issues to consider
     include what fire extinguishers or fire blankets are required, signing of
     fire exits, appointing fire marshals and organising fire practices.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><u>Working out of the office</u>:
     If anyone is expected to travel or to work anywhere other than their
     office or home then your risk assessment and policy should cover
     associated risks. Take particular care if people travel to high-risk
     countries, or any location where they may be at extra risk.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><u>Food safety</u>: If your
     firm provides food for staff or meetings it is vital that the relevant
     manager has appropriate food safety training and follows appropriate
     procedures e.g. on disposal of food which may no longer be safe to eat.</li>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the statement of the general health and safety policy
and arrangements for ANP Solicitors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Responsibilities</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The firm’s COLP for the time being has overall responsibility
for health and safety, including for assessing risks, carrying out an annual review
and monitoring standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Directors have day-to-day responsibility for ensuring this
policy is put into practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Statement of General Policy:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The firm seeks to ensure, so far as it can, that everyone in
its offices has a safe environment in which to work, free from avoidable risks.
The firm has concluded that it is generally a low risk environment, and is not aware
of any unusual hazards to health and safety. However, no environment is risk free.
Accordingly the firm’s policy is to do the following.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Manage health and safety risks</b> to prevent accidents and cases
of work-related ill health. To this end risk assessments are carried out at appropriate
times and actions arising out of those assessments are implemented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Implement emergency procedures</b>, particularly for evacuation
in case of fire or other significant incident. To this end escape routes are kept
well signed and clear. Evacuation plans are tested from time to time and updated
as necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Maintain safe and healthy working conditions</b>, provide and maintain
plant, equipment and machinery, and ensure safe storage/use of substances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The Role of All Staff</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All staff are expected to play their part in reducing any health
and safety risks. In particular you should do the following.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Take care for your own safety and that of others,
     including visitors.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Follow policies and instructions designed to maintain health
     and safety. For example the firm imposes restrictions on electrical items that
     may be brought into and used in the office and a failure to comply will be
     considered a disciplinary matter. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Report any hazards of which you are aware, including if you
     believe you or others are under unacceptable levels of stress.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Take part in any training or exercises the firm may organise.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:3.0pt'><b>Legal Compliance:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:3.0pt'>Health and safety law poster is displayed
on the Kitchen Door</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:3.0pt'>First-aid box is located next to
