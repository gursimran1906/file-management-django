<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>GIFTS AND
ANTI-BRIBERY POLICY</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>1.         General
Principles</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>You must avoid
any situation in which anyone could suppose that there was a risk of someone’s
behaviour being influenced improperly by a gift or other improper inducement being
given or received. Otherwise the SRA Code of Conduct and the Bribery Act 2010
may result in heavy penalties for you and the firm. It is important that if you
have any concerns in this area you do not keep them to yourself.<br>
<br>
The person responsible for the supervision of this policy is the COLP. That is
the person to whom you should report matters under this policy, and who may
give necessary approvals.  If in doubt, always discuss the matter with him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>2.         Gifts
From Clients</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Sometimes a grateful
client may wish to show his or her appreciation.  That may take the form of
entertainment (invitations to sports events etc.) or gifts to you or your
family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Refusing a gift
can hurt the lawyer-client relationship, particularly if the gift is small (a
bottle of champagne, etc.) or some sort of entertainment.  In general the firm
encourages close relationships between lawyer and client.  Thus occasional
small gifts and entertainment invitations should be graciously accepted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:11.65pt;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>However a valuable gift,
some forms of gift, or even a series of modest gifts, may threaten your independence
in your relationship with the client, and thus influence your legal judgements
and billing practices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:11.65pt;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>A significant gift may
create an “own client” conflict of interests. Under the SRA Code of Conduct Indicative
Behaviour 1.9 is “refusing to act where your&nbsp;<a
href="javascript:handleLink('/solicitors/handbook/glossary#client','glossary-term-85')"
title="Get definition for client"><span style='color:black;text-decoration:
none'>client</span></a>&nbsp;proposes to make a gift of significant value to
you or a member of your family, or a member of your&nbsp;<a
href="javascript:handleLink('/solicitors/handbook/glossary#firm','glossary-term-86')"
title="Get definition for firm"><span style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>firm</span></a>&nbsp;or
their family, unless the&nbsp;<a
href="javascript:handleLink('/solicitors/handbook/glossary#client','glossary-term-87')"
title="Get definition for client"><span style='color:black;text-decoration:
none'>client</span></a>&nbsp;takes independent legal advice”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>One must also
be aware of how gifts might be perceived by a third party.  Accordingly the
following rules apply to all employees and partners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='page-break-after:avoid'><span style='font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>(a)        Gifts of Cash or Cash Equivalents</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Neither you nor
your family shall accept any gift of cash or cash equivalents from a client, no
matter what size.  &quot;Cash equivalents&quot; include, but are not limited
to, gift vouchers and securities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>(b)        Entertainment</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Entertainment
usually falls into two categories: business and non-business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Business
entertainment usually occurs when the lawyer and the client are meeting
primarily to conduct the client's affairs or socializing in a business context
(e.g. where the client pays a lunch bill).  There is no problem accepting such
client generosities, except that if the entertainment exceeds £500 in value, you
should disclose it. Acceptance does not require advance approval, only
disclosure.  If such invitations are repeated the firm may wish to review the
matter with you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Examples of
non-business entertainment include the client taking you to a sports or
cultural event.  Ordinarily these are one-time events which would have no
impact on your independence, but in some cases because of the financial
magnitude or the chance of repetition you must disclose such gifts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Accordingly,
before accepting a non-business entertainment invitation which might be
expected to exceed £250 in value, report the invitation.  Acceptance does not
require advance approval, only disclosure.  If such invitations are repeated,
the firm may wish to review the matter with you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>However if a
non-business entertainment invitation might be expected to exceed £1,500 in
value, first seek approval.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>(c)        Loans</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>You must not accept
a loan from a client unless the client is in the business of regularly lending
money.  If the client is in the business of lending money and the loan is made
under terms not generally available to others, report the matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>(d)        Services</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>You must not perform
free or discounted legal work in return for free or discounted goods or services
from a client.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>If a client
offers you free or discounted goods or services as a gift, that will fall
within the reporting and approval requirements applicable to non-business
entertainment in (b) above.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>(e)        Bequests</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>You must not write
a will which gives you or a close family member a bequest. If a client insists
on making the bequest you should explain that s/he should use a different firm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The firm may
make an exception for a will written for a close family member, if the bequest
is modest both in itself and in relation to the size of the estate, or is
merely a proportionate share of the estate, no greater than that of other
family members with an equal claim on the testator’s generosity.  Obtain approval
first.  Even then consideration should be given to having the will written by
another lawyer in the office after consulting the family member.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>(f)         Gifts
of Tangibles</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Try to
discourage gifts from a client to you or any member of your family.  However
you may accept a gift of tangible property if it is occasional and has a value
of £150 or less.  If the value exceeds that amount it should be disclosed.  The
firm may require the lawyer to refuse or return it.  If it exceeds £1,500 in
value, it should be reported before acceptance, if possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>(g)        Gifts,
Loans Etc. From Family Members</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The above restrictions
on gifts, non-business entertainment and loans are intended to apply to matters
arising out of a lawyer-client relationship and not matters which would occur
in the normal course between family members when the family member happens to
be a client.  However you should report all dealings with such family members
which exceed £10,000 in value, or which are unusual in nature, or which exceed
£1,500 in value if the family member concerned is vulnerable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>3.         Gifts
from Suppliers</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Some employees and
partners deal with suppliers of goods and services to the firm.  Such dealings
should be based on considerations of what is in the best interest of the firm and
its clients, and there must be no appearance of personal impropriety or
personal gain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>You should
therefore decline any gifts of the following kinds:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>cash or cash
equivalents (such as gift vouchers or securities)</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>loans, unless the supplier
is in the business of lending money and the loan is made on terms generally
available</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>participation in a
contest, sweepstake or other promotion, where prizes are awarded based on your
activities at the firm</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>free or discounted
services or goods, for personal use unless they fall within the exceptions
below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>You may however
accept the following:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>entertainment if the
primary purpose of the meeting or event is to learn about the supplier’s good
or services, and the entertainment does not exceed £250 in value</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>small gifts or
prizes not exceeding £100 in value, from supplier sponsored conferences and the
like, provided the goods are also offered to all attendees</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>occasional small
gifts or entertainment not exceeding £100 in value, and which you promptly
disclose.  Acceptance does not require advance approval, only disclosure.  If
such gifts or entertainment are repeated, the firm may wish to review the
matter with you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>4.         Gifts
and Fees for Speaking and Writing</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>If you are
offered gifts for speaking or writing on legal or business issues by non-clients,
you should try to negotiate a money sum so long as it is tactful to do so (as
it ordinarily would in the case of a commercial organisation) and render a firm
invoice in the usual way.  If payment is still only offered in kind, then you may
keep the reward if it is a &quot;one off&quot; and does not exceed £250 in
value.  Otherwise you must account to the firm for the reward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>This guidance
is not intended to address every situation which can arise, the firm may make
different arrangements in some cases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>5.         Gifts
to Clients</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Any gifts (whether
from the firm, or from employees or partners) to any employees or agents of a present
or prospective client must comply with the client's policy concerning the
receipt of gifts by its employees and agents.  Many clients have policies that
forbid their employees and agents from accepting gifts, or from accepting gifts
of other than nominal value, or that require approval or reporting.  The firm will
not reimburse you, nor otherwise pay for, the cost of any gifts to clients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>6.         Entertaining
Clients</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Entertaining a
client can be an excellent way to show our appreciation and to strengthen our
relationship with the client.  To be considered a reimbursable entertainment
expense however, you must participate in the entertainment and accompany the
client, not just bestow tickets on the client.  Please be sure to obtain
appropriate practice group approval for the entertainment expense.</span></p>
