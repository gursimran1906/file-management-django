<p class=MsoNormal>The firm may from time to time outsource some legal
activities and/or operational functions that are critical to the delivery of
legal activities (such as secretarial and paralegal services).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are mindful of the particular regulatory responsibilities
that apply when we outsource such work.  For the avoidance of doubt, these
particular regulatory responsibilities only apply if we ask others to undertake
work that we would normally do ourselves and for which we remain responsible. 
They do not <span lang=EN>apply where we are using a specialist service to
assist with the provision of legal services to a client, for example
instructing counsel, medical experts, tax experts, accountancy services, a
process server or a costs draftsman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our policy towards outsourcing legal activities or
operational functions that are critical to the delivery of legal activities is
as follows.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The Managing Director has overall responsibility for
     outsourcing arrangements, and no such arrangements will be entered into
     without her prior approval.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>We will carefully consider the credentials of providers of
     outsourced services, including their background and experience and other
     customer recommendations, before we outsource functions to them.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Where appropriate we will check that providers of
     outsourced services have suitable liability insurance.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>We will not outsource reserved legal activities to a
     person who is not authorised to conduct such activities.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>We will not enter into outsourcing arrangements unless we
     are satisfied that the following conditions are met.</li>
 <ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=a>
  <li class=MsoNormal>The arrangement is consistent with our duties to our
      clients, in particular our duty to provide a proper standard of service
      under Principle 5.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>The provider has taken all appropriate steps to ensure
      that our clients' confidential information will be protected, in
      accordance with SRA Code of Conduct Indicative Behaviour 4.3.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Where appropriate, the provider has arrangements to
      detect and deal with any conflicts of interest.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>We have appropriate contractual provisions with the service
      provider, in particular to comply with SRA Code of Conduct Outcome 7.10.</li>
 </ol>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt'>Outcome 7.10 requires, amongst
other things, “contractual arrangements that enable the SRA or its agent to
obtain information from, inspect the records (including electronic records) of,
or enter the premises of, the third party, in relation to the outsourced
activities or functions”.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=5 type=1>
 <ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=5 type=a>
  <li class=MsoNormal>We will have adequate opportunities to monitor the
      service provided, and the ability to terminate the outsourcing
      arrangement if that should be necessary.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>If we or a member of the firm has a business connection
      with the service provider, we comply with SRA Code of Conduct Chapter 12
      on separate businesses.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>We have included appropriate provision in our standard engagement
      letter(s) and terms of business to inform clients that some aspects of
      our service may be outsourced.</li>
 </ol>
 <li class=MsoNormal>We must all bear in mind that we remain responsible for
     any work that is outsourced.  Outsourcing does not abrogate our regulatory
     responsibilities or our duties to the client.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The operation of this policy will be monitored on a
     continuing basis, and it will be reviewed annually.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>  If anyone has questions or concerns about its operation,
     please consult the COLP.</li>
